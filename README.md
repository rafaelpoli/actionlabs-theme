Create a personalized WordPress theme based on the following requirements:

Layout: https://www.figma.com/file/fN51xKaXc9tgugARuPbMQ2/Teste-Wordpress?type=design&node-id=1241%3A7416&t=Ab5PUNdHne4fN7h7-1
  We have only the desktop layout available. Make the proper adjustments so that your implementation works on mobile devices as well.
  You must log into your own Figma account to have access to the Inspect tab.
  The theme should have a custom homepage template that displays a featured image and title for the latest 6 posts and a single post template.
  The header should include a navigation menu with links to the homepage and a custom "About" page. The layout of this page is available in our figma.
  The footer should display the copyright information.
  The theme should have a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
  Once you finish your implementation, push the theme into a public git repository of your choice and share it with us. There is no need to host it running.
  We are looking for the quality of your implementation, usage of standard WordPress functions, code organization, the quality of your HTMLs and CSSs and design adherence.
